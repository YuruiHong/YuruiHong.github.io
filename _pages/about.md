This is Yurui Hong's home on the web!

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Tsinghua University starting from 2024, majoring in bioinformatics. I have obtained two Bachelor's degrees, one in Chemical Biology for Pharmaceutical Sciences and one in Software Enginering. I am always interested in the inter section of biology and computer science and am actively seeking opportunities to apply computational techniques to biological research.
